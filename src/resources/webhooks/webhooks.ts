       * - The `capped-1080p` option produces a single MP4 file, called
       *   `capped-1080p.mp4`, with the video resolution capped at 1080p. This option
       *   produces an `audio.m4a` file for an audio-only asset.
       * - The `audio-only` option produces a single M4A file, called `audio.m4a` for a
       *   video or an audio-only asset. MP4 generation will error when this option is
       *   specified for a video-only asset.
       * - The `audio-only,capped-1080p` option produces both the `audio.m4a` and
       *   `capped-1080p.mp4` files. Only the `capped-1080p.mp4` file is produced for a
       *   video-only asset, while only the `audio.m4a` file is produced for an
       *   audio-only asset.

       * audio-only asset).
       *

       * In most cases you should use our default HLS-based streaming playback
       * (`{playback_id}.m3u8`) which can automatically adjust to viewers' connection
